**Because of a long time of being inactive, Kaiia and the rest of the Claudscape project have become a little unstable. I do not have enough time to restore it, so any contribution is welcome.**

# The Claudscape AI-project

Written in batch and vbscript, the Claudscape project is a way to make a smarter, faster-learning and easier-programmable AI.

## Kaiia

Kaiia (also written: kAIia) is the first AI created under this project (Claudscape) since being on Github, unfortunately the older AI's could not be restored (I had a data loss some time ago...) Kaiia is able to introduce herself:

> *ME:*
>
> > Who are you?

> *Kaiia:*
>>> i am kaiia, with the internal claudscape name 'claudkaiia'.
>>> I am part of the claudscape project, build to serve good people.
>>> Marnix Bloeiman conceived and started the claudscape project.
>>> The claudscape project is a project that revolves around smart artificial intelligence, and making it.
>>> These artificial intelligences are here to help humanity.
>>> I am one of them.
>>> Does that answer your question?

Yes, the introduction is a hardcoded part of her, programmed at the 'center' of her brain (the script that actually makes Kaiia 'Kaiia') I hardcode the Claudscape project to be nice and polite, like Kaiia mentioned: *`build to serve good people.`* okay she can probaly be angry and stuff. But as far as I'm concerned, she will always be able to go back to being soft. â€‹

### How to run Kaiia?

Kaiia can be a little unstable. But you can clone and run Kaiia on a Windows machine using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Marnix0810/Claudscape_AI-project.git
cd Claudscape_AI-project
REM Then you need to run the Kaiia-me:
cd claudkaiia
start cmd /c me.cmd && exit
```

To clone it you could also use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).
